# Calculus of Culture: Guangxi

```yaml
title: Circumventing the Black Box
subtitle: Calculus of Culture, Phase 1
place: Institute of Complexity Science and Big Data Technology, Guangxi University, China
time: March 21-23, 2017
contact: K.L. Nielbo: kln@cas.au.dk
```
## Phase 1
Goals:  
- Cross-disciplinary discussions of and data experiments with existing black box solutions resulting in a manifest that describes fundamental problems in culture analytics. The manifest will be made available as a preprint manifesto immediately after the meeting and subsequently published as major review.   
- Establishment of temporary research groups in the network with responsibility for spearheading solutions of specific problems. These groups will also commit to developing the parts of the data (data management in phase 2) and computational (software in phase 3) infrastructures related to their problems.
